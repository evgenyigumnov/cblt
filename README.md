# СBLT

![cblt](https://github.com/evgenyigumnov/cblt/raw/HEAD/logo.png)

Safe and fast minimalistic web server, written in Rust, that serves files from a directory and proxies requests to another server.

## Project Name Explanation 

The name **Cblt** appears to be a good shortened version of **Cobalt**. It retains the association with the element and strength, while also looking modern and minimalist. 

## Features
- KDL Document Language configuration (**Cbltfile**)
- Proxy requests to another server
- Serve files from a directory
- TLS support
- Gzip compression

## Quick Start
You can run Cblt with Cargo or Docker.
### Cargo
Install:
```bash
cargo install cblt
```
Run:
```bash
cblt
```

### Docker
```bash
docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 --restart unless-stopped --name cblt ievkz/cblt
```


### Test

```
curl -H "Host: example.com"  http://127.0.0.1/
curl --insecure https:/127.0.0.1/
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1/api/entry \
-H "User-Agent: curl/7.68.0" \
-H "Accept: */*" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"key":"value"}'
```

## "Cbltfile" configuration examples
### File server
```kdl
"*:80" {
    root "*" "/path/to/folder"
    file_server
}
```
### File server & Proxy
```kdl
"127.0.0.1:8080" {
    reverse_proxy "/test-api/*" "http://10.8.0.3:80"
    root "*" "/path/to/folder"
    file_server
}
```
### TLS support ([docs](https://github.com/evgenyigumnov/cblt/blob/main/tls.md))
```kdl
"example.com" {
    root "*" "/path/to/folder"
    file_server
    tls "/path/to/your/domain.crt" "/path/to/your/domain.key"
}
```

## Benchmark
Do test with Apache Benchmark (ab) for 300 requests with 100 concurrent connections. Download 5mb image from example.com/logo_huge.png

```bash
ab -c 100 -n 300 http://example.com/logo_huge.png
```
